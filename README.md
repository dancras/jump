# level design ideas

challenging jumps with little risk (due to short fall at start) have large risk a little later (large falls for the same jump)

sections with some kind of "chase" mechanic
 - instant kill
 - sonic the hedgehog style bubble mechanic

reverse gravity falling upwards section?

spikes?

higher jump from big fall bounce

items to solve certain jumps:
- swinging hookshot
- boost grenades
